# Rakuten
Repo for uploading our own projects to choose the best one. 
It is recommended to create a folder for each collaborator where each one will upload their contributions. 
Do not foget to instal Git LFS for large-size file management and track the large size files (more than 20 MB). 

Lastly, try to keep the images out of the remote repo to about cluttering and eternal pushes and pulls. 

Thanks for your contributions in order to choose the best codes for the final presentation.
